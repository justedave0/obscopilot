## Technology Choices

- **Python Version**: 3.9+
- **Twitch API Library**: TwitchIO or PyTwitchAPI
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 (cross-platform, modern UI)
- **OBS Integration**: obs-websocket-py 
- **Workflow Engine**: Custom implementation based on SpiffWorkflow
- **Database**: SQLite (for portability)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Python Client

## Example Use Cases

1. **Channel Point Redemption → OBS Action**
   - When viewer redeems "Show Bug" points reward
   - Toggle visibility of "Bug.mp4" source in OBS

2. **Subscription → AI Thank You Message**
   - When viewer subscribes to channel
   - Send AI-generated thank you message mentioning subscriber's name

3. **Chat Command → Scene Switch**
   - When moderator types command in chat
   - Switch to specified scene in OBS

4. **Raid → Welcome Sequence**
   - When channel receives raid
   - Play special animation, send welcome message, and switch scene

5. **Stream Start → Social Media Notification**
   - When stream goes live
   - Send notifications to connected platforms
